# VSCode Info 
VSCode is quickly becoming one of my favorite code editors. It's flexbile and allows for lots of tools to get things done. At the same time, there are often lots of little features to learn, which are easy to forget from project to project. 

This is my collection of resource for working in VSCode and setting things up. 

## VSCode Shortcuts 
- [Toggle Zen Mode](https://techstacker.com/vscode-toggle-zen-mode/) 
  - `Control + Shift + P` 

  **ðŸ‘Ÿ  VSCode Shortcuts**
- Run Code: `Control + Alt + N` 
- Comment out a selection of code with `Control + /` 
- Collapse file bar `Control + B`
- Indent section `Control + ]`


## Setting up Git 
Until seeing a recent Youtube tutorial I hadn't even thought of incorporating Git and VSCode, but it makes a lot of sense. It simplified having to run a lot of commands manually. Pretty easy setup as well.
